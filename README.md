# Data-manipulation
everything related to changing data, files and formats
this is a repository, containing code that I have used in the past to do various tasks of data manipulation on files, data sets etc

the BHI named files were used to count inactive ports on switches, a port with 0 input/output was deemed inactive and so a total was accumulated of how many ports on a switch 
were really used
